HELLO DEAR PROFESORS,

I WILL DO A FAST RUNTROUGH ON EXECUTING  AND UNDERSTANDING OUR CODE PROPERLY. 


### MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALL R SCRIPTS IN THE SAME DIRECTORY. 

### TO RUN THE APP : 

	Open 'MyApp Final Version 3' script and run it. 

THIS IS THE ONLY CODE YOU NEED TO EXECUTE. OTHER R SCRIPTS WILL BE EXECUTED AUTOMATICLY.  

ATTENTION !!!!

Make sure you have folowing R scripts in the same R directory : 

server5
ui1
theme

### THE 4 SCRIPTS TO RUN THE APP
 
	'MyApp Final Version 3' => Code for the preprocessing of the data before it enters the app. Plus The code to run the R shiny application. 

	'server5'			=> Code for the back-end of the app. In other words the server code. 

	'ui1'				=> Code for the front-end of the app. In other words the user interface code. 

	'theme'			=> Code for the choice of the 'theme' for the app.  

	


### TO MAKE THE PLOTS :

	Open the "GGPLOTS" R script and execute it. 

ATTENTION !!!! 
Make sure you have "GGPLOT ROC CURVE DATA.csv" file in the same directory. 

This is a table representing the confusion matrix for all 4 recomendation methods that we want to use. 


	### CLARIFICATION REGARDING THE DATA TO CREATE THE DONNUT PLOT : 
"""
data <- data.frame(
  category=c('Unknown Artists','Known Artists'),
  count=c(1759,10271)
)
"""
	The 'count' from the R script extract above, was obtained as follows : 
	
	The 'GGPLOT DONUT SHART DATA.CSV' file represents a table with the gp1 users data in long format. It has an extra colomn 'TF'. 
	
	True represents artists that are in the artist.dat document and False artists that are not in the artist.dat document. 

	Keep unique artists ID and then count the number of 'false' artists ID for the 'Unknown Artists' and 'true' artists ID for the 'Known Artists' count. 

(P.S use the 'TF' colomn to determine the 'false' artists ID and the 'true'
